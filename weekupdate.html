<h2><li><u>3rd February,2019</u></h2><h3><p>- Site cleaning:
Cleaning up on site includes properly disposing of any debris and trash. Often, the clean-up worker will do a walk-through
 with the contractor to get an idea of exactly what the contractor expects and to receive any special clean-up instructions. 
The clean-up worker’s supervisor, or the worker himself, if he is an independent contractor, often follows up with the contractor
 to confirm that the clean-up job met expectations.</p></h3></li><br/>
